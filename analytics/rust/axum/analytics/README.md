# Axum Analytics

A free and lightweight API analytics solution, complete with a dashboard.

## Getting Started

### 1. Generate an API key

Head to [apianalytics.dev/generate](https://apianalytics.dev/generate) to generate your unique API key with a single click. This key is used to monitor your specific API and should be stored privately. It's also required in order to access your API analytics dashboard and data.

### 2. Add middleware to your API

Add our lightweight middleware to your API. Almost all processing is handled by our servers so there is minimal impact on the performance of your API.

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/axum-analytics.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/axum-analytics)

```bash
cargo add axum-analytics
```

```rust
use axum::{routing::get, Json, Router};
use axum_analytics::Analytics;
use serde::Serialize;
use std::net::SocketAddr;

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct JsonData {
    message: String,
}

async fn root() -> Json<JsonData> {
    let json_data = JsonData {
        message: String::from("Hello World!"),
    };
    Json(json_data)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/", get(root))
        .layer(Analytics::new(<API-KEY>));

    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 8080));
    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind(addr).await.unwrap();
    println!("Server listening at: http://127.0.0.1:8080");
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}
```

### 3. View your analytics

Your API will now log and store incoming request data on all routes. Your logged data can be viewed using two methods:

1. Through visualizations and statistics on the dashboard
2. Accessed directly via the data API

You can use the same API key across multiple APIs, but all of your data will appear in the same dashboard. We recommend generating a new API key for each additional API server you want analytics for.

#### Dashboard

Head to [apianalytics.dev/dashboard](https://apianalytics.dev/dashboard) and paste in your API key to access your dashboard.

Demo: [apianalytics.dev/dashboard/demo](https://apianalytics.dev/dashboard/demo)

#### Data API

Logged data for all requests can be accessed via our REST API. Simply send a GET request to `https://apianalytics-server.com/api/data` with your API key set as `X-AUTH-TOKEN` in the headers.

##### Python

```py
import requests

headers = {
 "X-AUTH-TOKEN": <API-KEY>
}

response = requests.get("https://apianalytics-server.com/api/data", headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

##### Node.js

```js
fetch("https://apianalytics-server.com/api/data", {
  headers: { "X-AUTH-TOKEN": <API-KEY> },
})
  .then((response) => {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });
```

##### cURL

```bash
curl --header "X-AUTH-TOKEN: <API-KEY>" https://apianalytics-server.com/api/data
```

##### Parameters

You can filter your data by providing URL parameters in your request.

- `page` - the page number, with a max page size of 50,000 (defaults to 1)
- `date` - the exact day the requests occurred on (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `dateFrom` - a lower bound of a date range the requests occurred in (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `dateTo` - a upper bound of a date range the requests occurred in (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `hostname` - the hostname of your service
- `ipAddress` - the IP address of the client
- `status` - the status code of the response
- `location` - a two-character location code of the client
- `user_id` - a custom user identifier (only relevant if a `get_user_id` mapper function has been set)

Example:

```bash
curl --header "X-AUTH-TOKEN: <API-KEY>" https://apianalytics-server.com/api/data?page=3&dateFrom=2022-01-01&hostname=apianalytics.dev&status=200&user_id=b56cbd92-1168-4d7b-8d94-0418da207908
```

## Data and Security

All data is stored securely in compliance with The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

For any given request to your API, data recorded is limited to:

- Path requested by client
- Client IP address
- Client operating system
- Client browser
- Request method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
- Time of request
- Status code
- Response time
- API hostname
- API framework (FastAPI, Flask, Express etc.)

Data collected is only ever used to populate your analytics dashboard. All stored data is pseudo-anonymous, with the API key the only link between you and your logged request data. Should you lose your API key, you will have no method to access your API analytics.

### Data Deletion

At any time you can delete all stored data associated with your API key by going to [apianalytics.dev/delete](https://apianalytics.dev/delete) and entering your API key.

API keys and their associated logged request data are scheduled to be deleted after 6 months of inactivity.

## Monitoring

Active API monitoring can be set up by heading to [apianalytics.dev/monitoring](https://apianalytics.dev/monitoring) to enter your API key. Our servers will regularly ping chosen API endpoints to monitor uptime and response time. 
<!-- Optional email alerts when your endpoints are down can be subscribed to. -->
